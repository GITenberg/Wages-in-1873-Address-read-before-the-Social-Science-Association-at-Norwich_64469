1873.</h2>
<h3>Rise in Wages.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the following Address I shall
devote myself to the task of reviewing, I hope in an impartial
spirit, the most recent phases of the labour movement.&nbsp; The
great advance of wages is a conspicuous feature of modern English
industry, and is obviously due to the rapid growth of the general
trade of the country.&nbsp; The long depression following on the
panic of 1866 has been succeeded by a period of unprecedented
activity in every branch of our export trade.&nbsp; The demands
upon the labour-market have far exceeded the supply; and the
artisan and labourer have not been slow to take advantage of a
situation which afforded to them a brilliant opportunity.&nbsp;
Between 1866 and 1869 the value of the exports of the produce and
manufactures of the United Kingdom had remained stationary; while
it rose from &pound;190,000,000 in 1869, to &pound;256,257,000 in
1872.&nbsp; Such a leap was not possible without imposing a
strain upon the powers of our labouring population, which must
inevitably have led to a material alteration in the rate of
wages.</p>
<h3><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Not
attributable to strikes.</h3>
<p>It is too often alleged that the recent advance of wages is
attributable to a series of successful strikes.&nbsp; I maintain,
on the contrary, that a strike against a falling market is never
successful, and that Trades Unions, as an organisation for the
purpose of raising wages, can never do more than assist the
workman to obtain an advance at a somewhat earlier date than that
at which the competition among employers would have brought about
the same result.&nbsp; I may quote the unfortunate strike in
South Wales, at the commencement of this year, as a signal
instance of the inability of Trades Unions to cope with the
superior resources of employers when firmly united together.</p>
<h3>The recent strike in South Wales.</h3>
<p>It may be worth while briefly to recapitulate the most
important incidents of the South Wales strike.&nbsp; In June
1872, the miners had proposed to apply for an advance of 20 per
cent. on their wages.&nbsp; They were, however, advised by the
executive council of their Union to limit their demand to an
advance of 10 per cent.&nbsp; The advance was granted, and three
months later the men asked for an additional 10 per cent.&nbsp;
Their application was refused, and shortly afterwards the masters
gave notice of a 10 per cent. reduction.&nbsp; The men thereupon
desired that their case should be referred to arbitration.&nbsp;
This request was refused by the masters, who were so fully
convinced of the strength of their own case, that they offered to
submit their books for the inspection of the workmen.&nbsp; The
miners were unwilling to avail themselves of this offer; and,
encouraged by large promises of support <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>from Mr. Halliday and Mr. Pickard,
they went out on strike.</p>
<p>Without venturing to apportion to either of the contending
interests their share of responsibility, it is clear that the
ironmasters were alone in a position to know whether their
business was sufficiently remunerative to make it possible to
dispense with a reduction of wages; and it was stated by Mr.
Crawshay that he had taken a contract for 2,000 tons of rails at
&pound;9. 2<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> per ton nett, and that he lost
money by selling rails at that price.&nbsp; Mr. Crawshay
expressed an opinion, founded on the statements made by his
workmen in daily interviews, that, but for the interference of
the Union, they would have been satisfied with the explanations
which he had given them, and returned to their work.&nbsp; In
short, it became a point of honour with the masters to prove to
their workmen that they were able, when acting in concert, to
fight a successful campaign against the united forces of the
Miners&rsquo; Union.</p>
<p>The miners, on the other hand, were in the embarrassing
position in which workmen are always placed whenever they are
engaged in similar disputes.&nbsp; They had to struggle in the
dark, and had no means of correctly estimating the profits of
their employers.&nbsp; The responsibility of the Executive
Council of the Miners&rsquo; Union, during the labour crisis in
South Wales, was immense.&nbsp; Although the miners connected
with the Union were only 10,000 in number, by their cessation of
labour 50,000 of their fellow-workmen, engaged in various
branches of the iron trade, were kept out of <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>work.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;strike pay&rsquo; distributed by the Colliers&rsquo; Union
amounted to a total of &pound;40,000, a sum quite insignificant,
by comparison with the amount of &pound;800,000, which the men
would have earned, had they continued at work; and yet the burden
of sustaining a vast population proved eventually
insupportable.&nbsp; In point of fact, the men were only enabled
to continue the struggle by the assistance of the tradesmen of
the district; and when, at length, the latter found themselves
unable to continue the supply of the necessaries of life on
credit, surrender was inevitable.</p>
<p>The reaction against the International Society among the
working classes in Belgium originated in a similar cause.&nbsp;
In 1871, during the strike in Flanders, the International was
unable to fulfil its promises of support, and it has consequently
lost credit with the operatives, many of whom, as we are informed
by Mr. Kennedy, have withdrawn from the Society.&nbsp; It was the
same with the miners at Waldenburg, in Silesia, where 6,000 men
went out on strike.&nbsp; After all their savings had been
exhausted, they received a grandiloquent despatch from the
Central Council at Berlin, urging them to emigrate <i>en
masse</i>.&nbsp; A few obeyed the advice.&nbsp; The majority who
remained were compelled to surrender, being consoled by the
assurance that the most valiant armies must sometimes yield to
superior numbers, and that they had won for themselves the
admiration of Germany.</p>
<p>Almost to the last the originators of the strike in South
Wales opposed the generally felt desire to return <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>to work.&nbsp;
Never, perhaps, was the magical power of eloquence over an
imperfectly educated audience more conspicuously displayed than
at the meetings held by the workmen towards the close of the
South Wales strike.&nbsp; Men, who had gathered together, for the
express purpose of negotiating a peace with their employers, were
turned aside against their own judgments by the eloquent
exaggerations of orators, who were interested in the continuation
of the struggle.</p>
<p>Overwhelming, indeed, is the influence of speech over the
uninstructed mind.&nbsp; Well may Carlyle exclaim: &lsquo;He who
well considers, will find this same right of speech, as we
moderns have it, to be a truly astonishing product of ages; and
the longer he considers it, the more astonishing and
alarming.&nbsp; I reckon it the saddest of all the curses that
now lie heavy on us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the event, as I have said, the workmen returned to their
work on the terms, which their masters had originally
proposed.&nbsp; Happily they had not long to wait for an
improvement of their position; and, in less than a fortnight
after the close of the strike, the workmen received an advance of
10 per cent. on the reduced wages, which they had accepted.</p>
<h3>Proposal of the International for an universal strike.</h3>
<p>The defeat of the miners in South Wales offers, as I have
already said, one more illustration of the inability of workmen
to force a concession from employers possessed of abundant
resources, when the state of trade is such, that a concession
cannot be made, without involving the employer in direct
pecuniary loss.&nbsp; We have evidence that this fact is becoming
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>generally
recognised.&nbsp; The inability of Trades Unions to control the
rate of wages was frankly admitted by the members of the
International Society in their last congress, when the working
men were informed that hereafter, if they wished to secure any
substantial advantages for labour, there must be a strike <i>en
masse</i> of all the working men of every country in the
world.</p>
<h3>In extreme cases strike may produce results beneficial to
workmen.&nbsp; Orderly conduct of men on strike in South
Wales.</h3>
<p>While I feel bound to assure the working man of the certain
frustration of his expectations, if he seeks to obtain from
capital impossible concessions, I am at the same time ready to
acknowledge that a strike will sometimes make an impression on
employers, even in cases, in which the demand for an increase of
wages is not immediately conceded.&nbsp; If the trade, in which
the workmen on strike are engaged, is prosperous for the
employer; cessation of production means loss of profit.&nbsp; The
apprehension of a recurrence of such loss may, on a future
occasion, induce concessions; and the wage-earning classes may
rest assured that, in the long run, and without the assistance of
Trades Unions and the disastrous interruptions to their business
occasioned by protracted strikes, the competition among
employers, to secure the services of workmen, will infallibly
lead to a rise of pay, proportionate to the amount of profit,
derived from the particular industry, with which they are
connected.&nbsp; It was a noteworthy feature in the South Wales
strike, that the men never had recourse to physical
violence.&nbsp; I attribute their good conduct in this regard in
part to the influence of Mr. Halliday and his colleagues.</p>
<h3><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Advance
in price of coal.</h3>
<p>I now pass to the graver subject of the recent rise in the
price of coal.&nbsp; It will be remembered that, on the motion of
Mr. Mundella, a Committee of the House of Commons was appointed
in the last Session to inquire into this subject.&nbsp; After a
long investigation the Committee reported, as might have been
expected, that, in their judgment, the rapid development of the
iron industry was the primary cause of the advance in the price
of coal.&nbsp; It appears from statistics, compiled under the
direction of the Committee, that the total production of coal in
1869 was 107,000,000 tons, of which 79,000,000 were used in
manufactures.&nbsp; The total production in 1871 was 117,000,000
tons, of which 85,000,000 were used in manufactures.&nbsp; It
will thus be seen how large a proportion of the total quantity of
coal raised is consumed in manufactures, and specially in the
manufacture of iron.&nbsp; In 1867, 567,000 tons of pig iron were
exported, 4,193,000 tons of pig iron were converted into rolled
iron, 1,317,000 tons of rolled iron were exported, and 28,331,000
tons of coal were used in the manufacture of iron.&nbsp; In 1872,
1,333,000 tons of pig iron were exported, 5,390,000 tons of pig
iron were converted into rolled iron, 2,055,000 tons of rolled
iron were exported, and 38,229,000 tons of coal were consumed in
the manufacture of iron.</p>
<h3>Mr. Lothian Bell.</h3>
<p>In the evidence, which he gave before the Committee, Mr.
Lothian Bell stated that the greatly increased demand for the
manufacture of iron, although not the sole cause, was one of the
causes, of the rapid advance in the price of coal.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>In his
district the iron trade gave a great stimulus to the coal
trade.&nbsp; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; he observed, &lsquo;all industry
throughout the country has been, and still is, in a very
flourishing condition.&nbsp; The manufacture of alkali in the
North, the increase of railways, the substitution of steam for
sailing vessels, all added to demands on an output not very
greatly increasing.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is to be observed that the
rise in the price of iron preceded the rise in the price of
coal.&nbsp; Mr. Lothian Bell quoted figures, from which it
appeared that, in September 1871, forge pig iron was selling for
50<i>s.</i>, while coke was selling for from 10<i>s.</i> to
12<i>s.</i> a ton.&nbsp; In July 1872, the forge pig iron rose to
120<i>s.</i>&mdash;more than double the price of nine months
before&mdash;and coke, following the advance in iron, rose from
37<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 41<i>s.</i> a ton.</p>
<p>The Committee rightly observe, in commenting upon these
figures, that, although the disturbance in the proportion between
the demand and the supply of coal might not appear sufficient to
explain fully the great rise of prices, yet a comparatively small
deficiency in the supply of an article of paramount necessity may
produce a disproportionate increase of price, through the
eagerness of buyers competing with each other, each for his own
supply.</p>
<h3>Rise of wages in collieries.</h3>
<p>Other reasons for the rise in the price of coal have been
urged, and among these more especially the reduction in the hours
of labour, and the great advance of wages.&nbsp; The advance in
the wages paid to miners is in truth extraordinary.&nbsp; In a
large colliery, in which I have an interest, I will give the
advance in the weekly <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>wages of some of the principal
trades.&nbsp; The weekly wages of hewers in 1869 were 24<i>s.</i>
5<i>d.</i>; they have risen in 1873 to 48<i>s.</i>
9<i>d.</i>&nbsp; The wages of timbermen in 1863 were 25<i>s.</i>;
in 1873 they are 53<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&nbsp; Haulers, in 1869,
20<i>s.</i>; in 1873, 31<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; Landers, in
1869, 21<i>s.</i>; in 1873, 36<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>&nbsp;
Labourers in 1869, 15<i>s.</i>; in 1873, 24<i>s.</i> a
week.&nbsp; The average wages of all the men employed were
20<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> for 1869, as compared with an average of
36<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per week in 1873.</p>
<p>A similar rise of wages has been established in other parts of
the country, of which I have no personal knowledge.&nbsp; Wages
have risen, since 1870, 48 per cent. in Northumberland, and 50
per cent. in Durham.&nbsp; The requirements of the Mines
Regulation Act have involved an additional expenditure, estimated
by some authorities at 12&frac12; per cent. upon the cost of
production.&nbsp; It was estimated by Mr. Pease that the total
cost of working, in the collieries with which he was connected,
had increased 50 per cent. between 1870 and 1872.&nbsp; Mr. A.
Macdonald, the president of the Miners&rsquo; National
Association, confirming the opinion of Mr. Pease, estimated that
the cost of getting coal in Northumberland had increased, between
1868 and 1872&ndash;73, from 60 to 65 per cent., while the
selling price had risen 120 per cent.</p>
<h3>Increased profits of colliery proprietors.</h3>
<p>It might be easily made to appear that the rise of wages was
the principal cause of the advance in coal.&nbsp; But the case
would be imperfectly presented for examination, if the profit
derived from the working of the pits were not ascertained.&nbsp;
The colliery, to which I <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>have already referred, had, for
years, been worked at a serious loss&mdash;there being no
dividend for the proprietors in the years 1870 and 1871.&nbsp;
Indeed, the prospects were so gloomy in the latter year, that
some of the shareholders in the undertaking made over their
interest to their co-proprietors at a considerable
discount.&nbsp; At length, however, the tide suddenly turned, and
in 1872 an ample dividend was earned; while there is every
prospect that the results of the present year may be still more
favourable.</p>
<h3>Rise of wages has followed advance in price of coal.</h3>
<p>My individual experience abundantly confirms the opinion
expressed by the Committee of the House of Commons, to the effect
that the prices of coal, which prevailed for years before the
present rise commenced, were so low that they did not afford a
reasonable profit to the owners of collieries in general, or such
remuneration as the workmen might, with regard to the hazardous
and arduous nature of their labour, reasonably expect.&nbsp; The
rise in the rate of wages has not, under the exceptional
circumstances, been unreasonable; and it is certain that the real
order of events has been, first, the rise in price of iron, then
a rise in the price of coal, and lastly a rise in the rate of
wages.&nbsp; On the other hand, great as the profits in the coal
trade have been, it is a question whether the last two years have
compensated the coal-owners for the former protracted era of
stagnation, and, in many cases, of serious loss.</p>
<p>In a letter addressed to <i>The Times</i>, early in the
present year, in which the case of the masters was ably argued,
Mr. Laing narrated the history of the <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Bleanavon Company.&nbsp; Owing to
various causes, that concern had been worked for several years
without profit.&nbsp; Only within the last three years had it
become a profitable undertaking; and yet all through a long
period of adversity an amount of &pound;3,000 to &pound;4,000 a
week was paid in wages, at the same rate as by the most
prosperous iron works; and the capital sunk by the original
proprietors was the means of creating a town, and supporting a
population of 9,000, in a secluded mountain valley of South
Wales.</p>
<h3>Causes which will lead to a reduction in price of coal.</h3>
<p>The present unprecedented prosperity may continue for a year
or two years at the most, but, at the end of that time, the
influx of capital into the coal trade, attracted by the present
high profits, will infallibly lead to some reduction of
price.&nbsp; New coal pits are being sunk.&nbsp; Old pits are
being improved.&nbsp; More workmen are being trained in the
business of mining.&nbsp; Hence we may look with confidence to an
augmentation of the output, and to a sufficient supply for the
ordinary demands of consumers.&nbsp; The insufficient profits of
former days cannot be attributed to the unreasonable standard at
which wages were maintained.&nbsp; The excessive competition in
the supply of coal was the true cause of the unfortunate position
of the trade.&nbsp; And as in the former period of depression, so
in the sudden and it may be short-lived prosperity of the present
day, the rates of wages must be regarded, not as a cause, but as
a consequence, of an abnormal position of affairs.</p>
<h3>Hours of labour.</h3>
<p>Complaints have been urged as to the effects of <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>shortening
the hours of labour; and it is certain that if a comparison be
made between the amount raised and the total number of
individuals employed, a less quantity is raised than in former
years.&nbsp; It must not, however, be forgotten that high wages
have attracted many untrained hands to the coal pits.&nbsp; It
would be presumptuous in me to express an opinion as to the
precise number of hours, which would constitute a fair working
day in a coal pit.&nbsp; Mr. Macdonald, who has had actual
experience as a working miner, declares that the present earnings
could not be obtained with less than eight hours of work a day,
and that no man, who laboured assiduously for that number of
hours could work continuously six days a week at coal
mining.&nbsp; It will be the duty of those, to whom the miners
are in the habit of looking for guidance, to watch with care the
course of trade.&nbsp; They know that the iron manufactures of
this country can only prosper, so long as we are able to sell our
iron abroad at cheaper rates than those demanded by foreign
producers.</p>
<p>There are some who think that a limitation of the hours of
labour is in itself an evil.&nbsp; I cannot share in this
view.&nbsp; Because some may make an unwise use of their newly
acquired advantages, that is no reason for returning to a former
state of things; when, in the general depression of trade, an
undue pressure was brought to bear upon the working man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; says Sir Arthur Helps, &lsquo;hard work
is a great police agent.&nbsp; If everybody were worked from
morning till night, and then carefully locked up, the register of
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>crime
might be greatly diminished.&nbsp; But what would become of human
nature?&nbsp; Where would be the room for growth in such a system
of things?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The use of leisure requires education, and that education had
not been freely given to the mechanics, miners, and puddlers, of
former generations.</p>
<h3>The double-shift system.</h3>
<p>Among the various proposals for maintaining the production of
collieries while conceding to the individual workman the
advantage of a reduction in the number of hours of daily labour,
the double-shift system of working promises a most satisfactory
result.&nbsp; When the memorable struggle was commenced in
Newcastle for a reduction in the number of hours, I ventured to
suggest, in an address delivered at Birkenhead, that the solution
of the difficulty, which had arisen in the engineering
establishments, might be found in employing relays of mechanics
to succeed each other at the same machine.&nbsp; When we have to
combine human labour with machine power, we know that it is
impossible for the human machine to keep pace with machinery of
brass and iron.&nbsp; But why, I venture to ask, should not a
machine, which never tires, be tended by two or three artisans
relieving each other as one watch relieves another on board
ship?&nbsp; In driving the machinery of steamships, it has been
found necessary, on long voyages, to have three sets of engineers
and firemen.&nbsp; Why should not the day be divided into three
periods of eight hours, or the working day be extended to sixteen
hours, two sets of men being employed?&nbsp; The change, arising
from the increasing use of machinery, <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>seems to render corresponding
modifications in the application of labour essential.&nbsp; My
friend Mr. Elliott is pushing the system of a succession of
labour in collieries with very advantageous results to all
parties concerned.&nbsp; Comparing a Durham colliery, worked on
the double-shift system, with a colliery in Glamorganshire,
worked by one set of miners, he ascertained that twice the
quantity of coal per day was being raised in Durham.&nbsp; The
prejudices of the miners in South Wales against the double-shift
have presented a serious obstacle to its introduction, but Mr.
Elliott hopes that this may eventually be overcome by the
influence of Mr. Macdonald and other representatives of the men,
whose superior intelligence will enable them to appreciate more
readily the advantages of new and improved systems of
working.</p>
<h3>Coal-cutting machines.</h3>
<p>Among various improvements, which may tend to reduce the price
of coal, we may look with confidence to the increased use of
coal-cutting machinery as a substitute for manual labour; and to
the discovery of methods by which the consumption of fuel may be
reduced.&nbsp; The experiments, which have been tried with the
machines invented by Captain Beaumont, R.E., and others, have
been eminently satisfactory; and these machines are now being
made in large numbers in Glasgow and Birmingham.</p>
<h3>Waste of coal in domestic consumption.</h3>
<p>Our domestic consumption is undoubtedly wasteful; and the
inventor of an effective improvement in the form of grate in
common use will be a real benefactor to his fellow-man.&nbsp;
Already we have, in the cooking-stove <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>for yachts, the invention of Mr.
Atkey, of Cowes, a highly successful apparatus.&nbsp; A letter
from Mr. Vale, Ex-President of the Liverpool Architectural
Society, addressed to <i>The Times</i> in August last, describes
a cooking stove for a party of nine persons and a crew of
thirteen men, which measured only one foot four inches by one
foot four inches in area, and one foot nine inches in height, the
actual fuel-space being less than one cubic foot.&nbsp; The fuel
required in his yacht for one day&rsquo;s consumption was
forty-seven pounds of coke at twenty shillings a ton, and the
cost per head per day amounted to less than one farthing.</p>
<h3>Captain Galton&rsquo;s fireplace.</h3>
<p>In his lecture, delivered at Bradford during the meeting of
the British Association in the present year, Mr. Siemens
described Captain Galton&rsquo;s ventilating fireplace as a most
valuable invention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The chief novelty and merit,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;of
Captain Galton&rsquo;s fireplace consists in providing a chamber
at the back of the grate, into which air passes directly from
without, becomes moderately heated (to 84&deg; Fah.), and, rising
in a separate flue, is injected into the room under the ceiling
with a force due to the heated ascending flue.&nbsp; A plenum of
pressure is thus established within the room whereby indraughts
through doors and windows are avoided, and the air is continually
renewed by passing away through the fireplace chimney as
usual.&nbsp; Thus the cheerfulness of an open fire, the comfort
of a room filled with fresh but moderately warmed air, and great
economy of fuel, are happily combined with unquestionable
efficiency and simplicity; and yet this <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>grate is
little used, although it has been fully described in papers
communicated by Captain Galton, and in an elaborate report made
by General Morin, le Directeur du Conservatoire des Arts et
M&eacute;tiers of Paris, which has also appeared in the English
language.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Mr. Bessemer&rsquo;s inventions.</h3>
<p>But economy in the consumption of coal, in the manufacture of
iron, is a far larger question than economy, however desirable in
itself, in the consumption for domestic purposes; and, as an
illustration of what may be achieved in this direction, I will
quote some extracts from a letter from Mr. Bessemer, detailing
the results, which have actually been attained through his most
valuable discoveries.</p>
<p>The average quantity of coal required to make a ton of pig
iron is about two tons of coal to a ton of pig; and, as pig iron
forms the raw material for the several processes of manufacturing
both malleable iron and steel, we may treat the pig simply as the
raw material employed, and consider only how much coal is
required to make a ton of finished rails.&nbsp; About two tons of
coal are required in order to convert pig iron into iron railway
bars.</p>
<p>To produce one ton of steel rails by the old process of making
steel in Sheffield, a total consumption of ten tons eight cwt. of
coal is required; and the conversion of iron bars into blistered
bars occupies from 18 to 20 days.</p>
<p>To make Bessemer&rsquo;s steel from pig iron into steel rails
requires about five cwt. of small coal, in the form of coke, to
melt the pig iron in the cupola; two cwt. <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>to heat the
converting vessel and ladle; two cwt. for the blast engine, which
converts five tons of pig iron into fluid cast steel in twenty
minutes; and, lastly, for rolling the ingots into rails, sixteen
cwt. of coal, making a total consumption of twenty-five cwt. of
coal, in producing one ton of Bessemer&rsquo;s steel rails from
pig iron.&nbsp; Thus, common iron rails take two tons of coal;
Sheffield cast steel rails, ten tons eight cwt.; Bessemer&rsquo;s
steel rails, one ton five cwt.</p>
<p>But we must also consider other points in connection with
these figures, in order to arrive at a correct estimate of the
saving of coals, effected by the introduction of steel, as a
substitute for iron.</p>
<p>Although the cost of Sheffield steel entirely shut it out of
the market for rails, it must be borne in mind that it was
extensively used for wheel tires, slide bars, piston rods, and
other parts of locomotive engines; and here a saving of over nine
tons of coal per ton of steel has been effected.&nbsp; Further,
it must be borne in mind that at stations where rails are rapidly
worn, the saving by the use of steel, as a substitute for iron,
must not be simply estimated as a saving made on one ton of each
material.&nbsp; For instance, at the London and North-Western
station, at Crewe, the iron rails are so rapidly worn, that they
require to be reversed every four months, each rail being
completely worn out in eight months.&nbsp; Bessemer&rsquo;s steel
rails were first used at this station, and after being in
constant use for seven years, they were removed in consequence of
rebuilding the station; one side only of the rail having been
used, and <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>this was not quite worn out.&nbsp; During the seven
years, therefore, that those rails were down, one ton five cwt.
only of coal had been employed in the production of each ton of
rails used at this station; whereas ten sets of iron rails would
have been entirely worn out in that period, each set consuming
two tons of coals in its manufacture, or equal to twenty tons of
coals for iron rails, as against one ton five cwt. of coals for
steel rails; and these, when turned, would be equal to another
seven years&rsquo; wear on the side not used.</p>
<p>The above is, no doubt, an extreme case, but the same sort of
thing goes on everywhere where steel is used, though in a lesser
degree.&nbsp; It has indeed been admitted by competent persons,
that the rapid destruction of iron rails would have caused a
complete collapse of the Metropolitan railways by continued
interference with the traffic, while removing the worn-out rails,
had not steel been employed.</p>
<p>It should further be borne in mind that the extra strength of
steel over iron admits of a reduction of one-third of its weight
in all structures, previously made in iron.&nbsp; Thus, a further
saving is effected in the fuel consumed for a given work.</p>
<p>The rapidity, with which Bessemer&rsquo;s steel is coming into
use, will be appreciated, when it is stated that the report of
the jury at the London International Exhibition showed that the
entire production of steel in Great Britain, prior to
Bessemer&rsquo;s invention, amounted to 51,000 tons per annum;
while the quantity of Bessemer&rsquo;s steel, made in Great
Britain during the twelve <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>months ending June 1873, amounted to
481,000 tons, or nearly ten times the amount of production prior
to the invention.&nbsp; Had this quantity of steel been made by
the old Sheffield process, it would have consumed, according to
the foregoing figures, 4,401,000 tons more coal than was actually
employed in its production.&nbsp; Should this enormous increase
in the manufacture continue, as it at present promises to do, in
another five years, we may have treble the quantity of steel made
in this country with a corresponding saving of fuel.</p>
<h3>Reduced consumption of coal in steamers.</h3>
<p>In steam vessels a remarkable economy of fuel has of late been
attained.&nbsp; In his lecture at Bradford, Mr. Siemens said,
&lsquo;A striking illustration of what can be accomplished in a
short space of time was brought to light by the Institute of
Mechanical Engineers, over which I have at present the honour to
preside.&nbsp; In holding their annual general meeting in
Liverpool in 1863, they instituted a careful inquiry into the
consumption of coal by the best engines in the Atlantic steam
service, and the result showed that it fell in no case below
4&frac12; lbs. per indicated horse-power per hour.&nbsp; Last
year they again assembled with the same object in view in
Liverpool, and Mr. Bramwell produced a table showing that the
average consumption by 17 good examples of compound expansive
engines did not exceed 2&frac14; lbs. per indicated horse-power
per hour.&nbsp; Mr. E. A. Cowper has proved a consumption as low
as 1&frac12; lbs. per indicated horse-power per hour in a
compound marine engine, constructed by him with an intermediate
superheating vessel.&nbsp; Nor are we likely <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>to stop long
at this point of comparative perfection, for in the early portion
of my address I have endeavoured to prove that theoretical
perfection would only be attained if an indicated horse-power
were produced with 1/5.5 lb. of pure carbon, or say &frac14; lb.
of ordinary steam coal per hour.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Inventions of Mr. Siemens.</h3>
<p>The furnace invented by the Messrs. Siemens is another highly
successful contrivance.&nbsp; In melting one ton of steel in
pots, 2&frac12; tons of coke are ordinarily consumed.&nbsp; In
Messrs. Siemens&rsquo; furnace, a ton of steel is melted with 12
cwt. of small coal.</p>
<p>When such results as this have been secured by a few
inventors, what may we not venture to expect from the
concentration of many ingenious minds on the important problem of
economising coal?</p>
<h3>Substitution of peat for coal.</h3>
<p>As it is, I fear, certain that coal will never fall below
fifteen or sixteen shillings a ton at the pit&rsquo;s mouth, we
ought not to neglect any possible source of supply.&nbsp; It has
been suggested that the time has come when the peat bogs of these
islands should be turned into coal and charcoal; and I am
informed that the cost of the process does not exceed five
shillings a ton.&nbsp; If these anticipations are verified, the
drain on our coal-pits will be materially lessened.</p>
<h3>General prospects of the iron trade.</h3>
<p>It remains to consider how far the apprehensions, entertained
in many quarters for the future of the British iron manufacture,
are justified by actual experience.&nbsp; When we look back upon
the past, the growth of British commerce cannot fail to reassure
those, who are most inclined to look doubtfully on the future of
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>our
industry.&nbsp; Some statistics of the increase in the exports of
iron and steel were given in a recent number of
&lsquo;Iron,&rsquo; from which I quote the following
figures.&nbsp; Our exports of iron in 1840 amounted to 268,000
tons, of the value of &pound;2,526,000.&nbsp; The quantity in
1850 was 783,000 tons; in 1860, 1,442,000 tons; and in 1870,
2,716,000 tons.&nbsp; The value in the latter year amounted to
&pound;21,080,000.&nbsp; In 1872 the quantity was 3,383,000 tons,
the value of &pound;36,000,000.&nbsp; We are sometimes assured
that Belgium threatens our ironmasters with serious competition;
but in Belgium the ore must be carried 100 miles or more to be
smelted.&nbsp; The coal-pits are worked in many cases with
considerable difficulty, and a Belgian workman does little more
than half what an Englishman can accomplish in the same space of
time.&nbsp; Sometimes we are told we shall lose our position in
the Russian market.&nbsp; The Russian Government are doing their
utmost to encourage the manufacture of iron at home; though there
is little demand for pig iron in that country.&nbsp; Few Russians
have had any experience in puddling.&nbsp; Skilled mill and forge
men are scarce.&nbsp; Few of those obtainable have had any
experience in the use of mineral fuel, and great difficulty is
experienced in consequence of the objection of the Russians to
piece-work.&nbsp; Lastly we are threatened with competition from
the United States.&nbsp; The production of pig iron in the States
may now be estimated at 2,500,000 tons, an increase of 1,000,000
tons on the production five years ago, and yet the ironmasters of
the United States, who are protected by a duty of <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>nearly
&pound;3 a ton on railroad iron, have hitherto been unable to
supply the entire demand at home.&nbsp; There cannot be a doubt
as to the ultimate consequences of the comparative exhaustion of
our supplies of raw material at home; but we may hope that the
tariffs, which now throw obstacles in the way of legitimate
trade, will in time be removed, and that, as Mr. Mattieu Williams
has suggested, we may be enabled to avail ourselves of the
natural resources of America for obtaining our supplies of raw
material, just as we already derive large supplies of hematite
iron ore from Bilbao.</p>
<h3>American competition.</h3>
<p>At the present time, the United States, not content with their
natural advantages, impose an almost prohibitory tariff on our
exportations.&nbsp; There is a party in America opposed to
protection, but hitherto the superior organisation and greater
determination of the manufacturers interested in the maintenance
of the tariffs has overpowered all opposition.&nbsp; At the last
annual meeting of the American Institute of Mining Engineers at
Philadelphia, the Honourable D. Kelley, who delivered the opening
address, asserted that, by its dereliction of duty in not
protecting the labourer of Great Britain against competition, the
Government of this country have fostered anarchy in Ireland,
while the life of the labourer in England and Scotland has been
robbed of all its joys.&nbsp; &lsquo;The millions of sturdy
men,&rsquo; he declared, &lsquo;represented by Bradlaugh, Odger,
Joseph Arch, and the travelled and humane patrician, Sir Charles
Dilke, know that the world owes every man <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>a living, and
that it is only by protection that the means of living can be
secured to the people.&rsquo;&nbsp; So long as such a feeling
prevails, there is little hope of our ironmasters obtaining free
access to America.</p>
<p>The progress of the American iron works is the more
creditable, because great difficulties are experienced in
obtaining a sufficient supply of labour.&nbsp; Men come over from
England, having had their expenses paid, on condition of taking
an engagement for a period of five years.&nbsp; As soon as their
bargain is performed, they generally find it impossible to resist
the attractions of an independent farm in the Far West.&nbsp;
Their places must be supplied by other workmen, obtained by the
same costly means from the mother country.&nbsp; The difficulty
of obtaining skilled workmen has had a great effect in America in
stimulating the invention of labour-saving machinery; and as
scientific manufacturers, the American ironmasters can doubtless
hold their own against the world.&nbsp; In finished iron the
Americans have been highly successful.&nbsp; Bridge-work,
locomotives, wheels and tires, and machinery, are produced at
prices, which may compare not unfavourably with our own.&nbsp; As
an illustration of American ingenuity and enterprise, which came
under my immediate notice, on the occasion of a recent visit to
the States, I may point to the Peabody Rifle Company&rsquo;s
establishment at Providence, Rhode Island.&nbsp; During the
Rebellion the Company was fully employed in the manufacture of
small arms.&nbsp; The cessation of the struggle put an end to the
demand for rifles; but, with the fertility of <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>resource
which distinguishes American industry, the manual skill of a
large body of workmen especially apt in the production of tools
or machinery, composed of numerous small and interchangeable
parts, and the valuable and ingenious plant belonging to the
Company, are now employed in the production of sewing
machines.&nbsp; Three hundred machines are turned out every day,
and the sale is constantly increasing.&nbsp; The wages of the 500
operatives employed are most liberal.&nbsp; The monthly pay-sheet
amounts to 25,000 dollars, giving an average of 40<i>s.</i> a
week throughout the factory.&nbsp; The leading workmen, five or
six in number, to whom the work is let by the piece, or rather by
sub-contract, earn nearly &pound;600 a year.&nbsp; The superior
mechanics earn 12<i>s.</i> to 14<i>s.</i>; labourers 4<i>s.</i>
to 6<i>s.</i> a day.&nbsp; The supply of highly-skilled labour is
limited, but ordinary mechanics can always be obtained.&nbsp; On
an average, one skilled mechanic a day makes application for
employment.</p>
<p>The success of the Peabody Company affords significant
evidence that the cost of production is not augmented in equal
proportion to the high rates of pay.&nbsp; At the time of my
visit, they were negotiating a contract for the supply of 100,000
rifles to the Roumanian Government, at the rate of 63<i>s.</i>
per rifle; and they had to compete for the contract against all
the makers of Birmingham and Li&egrave;ge.&nbsp; This Company had
also in prospect an order for 200,000 rifles, from the Turkish
Government.&nbsp; The success, with which the Americans have
reduced the cost of production by the <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>invention of machinery, gives us
ground for caution, lest our old supremacy be shaken by the
energy and talent of the New World; while it also gives us reason
to hope that the effects of the exceptionally high rates of wages
now prevailing may be mitigated by substituting, wherever it is
possible, mechanical for manual labour.</p>
<h3>A monopoly of the iron trade impossible.</h3>
<p>I can only repeat once more that, in the present condition of
our trade, there is nothing to justify serious misgivings as to
our power of continuing a successful competition with foreign
producers.&nbsp; It does not follow that, because we have lost a
monopoly of a particular branch of trade abroad, the skill of the
English workman must have deteriorated, or the cost of production
have been unduly enhanced by the rise of wages.&nbsp; Foreign
countries may have imported from us a particular commodity at a
former time, solely because they were entirely inexperienced in
its manufacture.&nbsp; When my father was executing the Rouen and
Havre Railway, he imported the rails from England, although he
had to pay an import duty at the French Custom-house, amounting
to a considerably larger sum than the selling price of the rails
at home.&nbsp; The almost incredible difference between the price
of English and French rails at that time no longer exists:
because that special branch of industry is now as well understood
in France as in England.&nbsp; So, too, in the case of the
employment of English contractors for the execution of public
works on the Continent.&nbsp; An opportunity was offered to them
in the origin of the railway system on the Continent; because in
those <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>early days of railways there were no native contractors,
sufficiently acquainted with the art of making railways to
venture to compete with the English invaders.&nbsp; Their
intelligent observation of our methods of construction soon
enabled the contractors on the Continent to tender in competition
with the English; and for many years past all the railway works
in France have been carried out by Frenchmen.&nbsp; It does not
follow that the English contractor has lost his former
skill.&nbsp; The true inference is, that the French, who had been
previously in a position of inferiority solely from lack of
experience, were enabled, as soon as they had gained that
experience, to execute the works required, without the assistance
of foreigners.</p>
<p>The development of our commercial relations with France, since
the negotiation of the Treaty of Commerce, affords convincing
proof of the great capabilities of our manufacturing
industry.&nbsp; Since 1860, the exportation of iron, wrought and
unwrought, to France has increased in value &pound;540,000.</p>
<p>Looking therefore to the present condition of our iron trade,
there is nothing to justify serious misgivings.&nbsp; According
to the last report of the Commissioners of Customs, the average
value of the pig iron exported in 1870 was &pound;2. 19<i>s.</i>
2<i>d.</i> per ton; in 1871, &pound;3. 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; in
1872, &pound;5. 0<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>; and yet the demand for
pig iron continued unchecked.&nbsp; The increase in the quantity
exported in 1872 over 1871 was 28 per cent.&nbsp; The increase in
the price ranged as high as 108 per cent.</p>
<p>While the export of pig iron attained to the figures <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>I have
quoted, the total increase in the exports of iron and steel
manufactures did not exceed 6.7 per cent.&nbsp; Indeed the
manufacture of steel actually fell off from a value of
&pound;683,000 in 1871, to &pound;623,000 in 1872; a result the
more remarkable as compared with the increase in pig iron,
because the price of steel had not advanced in the same
proportion as the rise in pig iron.&nbsp; The price of the latter
article had risen, as I have said, from &pound;3. 1<i>s.</i>
8<i>d.</i> to &pound;5. 0<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> per ton; while
unwrought steel had only advanced from &pound;30. 12<i>s.</i>
3<i>d.</i> to &pound;32. 18<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> per ton, and
steel manufactures from &pound;52. 8<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> to
&pound;55. 4<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> per ton.</p>
<p>Hence it would appear that a demand once created for an
article of the first necessity, such as iron, is not easily
checked, even by a very marked advance of price.</p>
<p>It must, however, be remembered that, when the course of trade
has been changed, and consumers, alarmed by the high prices in
our market, have been taught to look for their supplies in
another, the position once lost is not easily recovered.&nbsp;
The superiority of our artisans in skill and industry has
assisted our manufacturers to compete successfully in the
past.&nbsp; The same success will not be maintained in future,
unless our employers and workmen continue, as before, to use
their united efforts to reduce the cost of production.</p>
<h3>Shipbuilding.</h3>
<p>Perhaps no branch of industry has been more successfully
prosecuted in this country than shipbuilding; and the extensive
use of iron for ships of the largest type makes it a point of
great interest to ascertain <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>how far the cost of building ships
has been affected by the recent advance of wages.&nbsp; I am
informed by an eminent firm of shipbuilders, that at the close of
1871, shortly after the reduction in the hours of labour from
fifty-nine or sixty hours a week to fifty-four, an agitation was
commenced amongst all classes of men for an advance in their
rates of wages, which has been, in some shape or other, conceded
to them, to the extent of from 7&frac12; to 15 per cent.&nbsp; In
reality, this was the natural consequence of the reduction in the
hours of labour; although, at the outset the leaders of that
movement professed that they had no desire to raise the rates of
wages.</p>
<p>The reduced hours of labour increased the cost of production
of all articles, and led to the necessity for an advance in the
rates of wages.&nbsp; In point of fact, the advantage of the
reduction in the hours of labour being conceded, on social and
moral grounds, the necessity for some corresponding advance in
wages followed as a matter of course, and was perhaps not
unreasonable.&nbsp; The two causes combined have resulted in an
increased cost of production, so far as labour is concerned, of
from 20 to 25 per cent.&nbsp; The cost of building first-class
steamers and first-class marine engines has, in consequence of
the rise in wages and materials, been increased from 30 to 40 per
cent.</p>
<p>The actual diminution, by the nine hours&rsquo; movement, in
the amount of work, turned out with a given plant, should, in
theory, be only in proportion to the reduced number of the hours
of work, or, <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>say, about one-tenth.&nbsp; It is in reality from 15 to
20 per cent.</p>
<p>From an eminent firm on the Clyde, I learn that on
riveters&rsquo; and smiths&rsquo; piece-work there has been an
increase of 20 per cent. and 10 per cent. respectively, in the
last two years; on the other hand, in fitters&rsquo; piece-work
there has been a decrease of 10 per cent.&nbsp; The price of
first-class steamers in 1871 was about &pound;24 per ton.&nbsp;
At present the cost would be from 30 to 35 per cent.
higher.&nbsp; While the building of sailing ships decreased in
1871 and 1872, in 1873 there has been an increase in the number
built.&nbsp; The building of steamers has not been so brisk in
1873 as in 1871 or 1872; a marked falling-off in orders having
taken place since the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>On the Thames I find that piece-work is at least 15 per cent.
dearer now than in 1869 and 1870.&nbsp; The operatives, employed
in attending to large self-acting machines, which require little
manual labour, are only working fifty-four hours instead of sixty
hours.&nbsp; Again, there has been a large increase of overtime,
since the nine hours&rsquo; movement commenced.&nbsp; Wages for
overtime are higher than for ordinary time.&nbsp; An hour and a
half&rsquo;s pay is given for every hour&rsquo;s work, and many
men refuse to work unless a certain amount of overtime is given
to them.</p>
<p>With these recent reports from shipbuilders it may be useful
to compare the general progress of shipbuilding in the United
Kingdom, in the last ten years.&nbsp; The tonnage of the ships
built increased from 328,000 tons <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>in 1867 to 475,000 tons in
1872.&nbsp; There has been no increase in the registered tonnage
in the interval, but the vast increase in the proportion of steam
to sailing vessels will fully explain the apparently stationary
condition of the mercantile marine, if tested solely by the
amount of tonnage.&nbsp; It is equally reassuring to find that,
in the estimation of foreigners best qualified to form an
opinion, the extent of our merchant navy excites profound
admiration.&nbsp; M. Bal, director of the Bureau Veritas, in
giving evidence before the French Parliamentary Commission of
inquiry into the condition of the French Mercantile Marine, said
that to him it seemed almost incredible that England, which has
only 27,000,000 inhabitants, had 6,903,000 tons of shipping,
whereas all the other maritime Powers combined had only 6,648,000
tons.</p>
<p>In the United States, until the quite recent, and still but
partial, revival of the trade, the decline of shipbuilding had
been very remarkable.&nbsp; In a country possessed of less
natural resource, the suffering, which would have been entailed
on the particular industries, would have been almost
insupportable.&nbsp; According to Mr. Wells, 15,000 men were
employed in New York, in 1860, in building and repairing marine
steam engines.&nbsp; In 1870, fewer than 700 found employment in
the same branch of industry.</p>
<p>In France, it would seem, from the report of Mr. West, that a
wooden ship costs from &pound;3 to &pound;4 a ton more than a
similar ship built in England or Canada; <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>and in regard
to iron steamers, the price of wrought iron in France for
shipbuilding purposes is so much higher than in England, as to
make competition impossible.</p>
<p>Amid the many difficulties of the present time, English
employers may perhaps take comfort by looking abroad, where they
will generally find that the same problems, with which they have
to deal, are presenting themselves, and often in a still more
aggravated form.</p>
<h3>The engineering trade.</h3>
<p>Passing from shipbuilding to engineering, I have ascertained
that in an establishment on the largest scale, in which the cost
of production has been minimised to the utmost, the increased
cost of production in 1871 over 1870 was, for wages, 2.73 per
cent., and for materials, 2.59 per cent.&nbsp; Again, the
increase in 1872 over 1871 was, for wages, 7.97, and for
materials, 7.94 per cent., thus showing that the most liberal
application of capital, the most ingenious machinery, and skilful
administration, had failed to compensate for the great advance in
the rate of wages.</p>
<p>I may also quote the following details from a report received
from an engineering establishment with which I am connected.</p>
<p>The average wages of some of the most important trades in our
employ in 1871, 1872, and 1873, were as follows:&mdash;</p>

</table>
<p>In reply to my inquiry, as to the effect of the nine
hours&rsquo; movement in diminishing the amount of work turned
out, I am informed that, while wages have considerably advanced,
no increased activity on the part of the men has taken
place.&nbsp; Indeed, less work is performed in nine hours now
than formerly when ten hours constituted an ordinary day&rsquo;s
work.</p>
<p>The rise of wages has been very considerable in the last two
years.&nbsp; The price of locomotives has, in consequence <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>of these
various causes, increased from 25 to 30 per cent.&nbsp; An
ordinary passenger engine, which might have been built in 1871
for &pound;2,200, cost in 1872 &pound;2,400, and in the present
year the price would be &pound;2,600.&nbsp; In modern marine
engines the cost of materials and labour is about equal.&nbsp; An
engine, which might have been built in 1871, at &pound;40 per
horse-power, would have cost in 1872 &pound;46.&nbsp; In the
present year the price has advanced from &pound;55 to &pound;60
per horse-power.</p>
<p>In one of the largest steel and iron works in the North I
learn that the wages of skilled hands are now from ten to sixteen
shillings a day, and have increased 25 per cent. since 1870.</p>
<p>Lastly, I am informed that there is no appreciable difference
in the dress or appearance of the working man in the town, in
which my works are situated, that there is more money and more
time spent in the public-house, and that time in the morning is
not so well kept now as it was before the nine hours&rsquo;
movement commenced.&nbsp; It is suggested to me that the
improvement in wages and the shortening of the time came too
suddenly upon the working man.</p>
<p>It is sometimes difficult to overcome a feeling of depression
as to the future of our mechanical industry.&nbsp; But, when we
look to the progress made in the past, there is no ground for
discouragement.&nbsp; The value of our exports of steam engines
in 1866 was &pound;1,760,000, in 1872 &pound;2,995,000.&nbsp; The
value of our exports of machinery of other sorts was, in 1866,
&pound;2,998,000; in 1872, &pound;5,606,000.&nbsp; The past has
been prosperous, <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>and there is no reason why a cloud should overshadow the
future of our industry, if only the time-honoured rule be
observed, of giving a fair day&rsquo;s work for a fair
day&rsquo;s wages.</p>
<h3>Rise of wages on Continent.</h3>
<p>I now proceed to examine the situation of affairs among our
continental rivals.&nbsp; Valuable materials for such
investigation are furnished to our hands by the
recently-published reports of our Secretaries of Legation, and by
a most important pamphlet prepared by Mr. Redgrave.&nbsp; From
these authorities we learn that, in the last ten years, wages at
Verviers, a great centre of industry in Belgium, have gradually
increased by 20 per cent. and that the working hours are shorter
than they were.&nbsp; At Ghent the rate of wages has risen 60 per
cent. in the last fifteen years.&nbsp; The average prices of the
necessaries of life show an increase in Belgium of 50 per cent.
in the last thirty years.&nbsp; Beef and mutton are now
8<i>d.</i> per pound, and bread is about 8<i>d.</i> the
four-pound loaf.&nbsp; The rise of wages has, however, been
greater in proportion than the increase in the cost of lodging,
clothes, and food.</p>
<p>In Prussia, Mr. Plunkett states that there is a universal
tendency to reduce the hours of labour, and to raise the rate of
wages.&nbsp; The Breslau Chamber of Commerce state that, in
consequence of the increased cost both of labour and raw
material, the prices of cotton carded yarn had advanced 10 per
cent. on the best and 16 per cent. on the ordinary
qualities.&nbsp; In the Silesian cloth trade, in 1871, prices
rose 15 per cent.</p>
<p>In the spinning and weaving factories in Silesia, <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>according to
a statement by Dr. G. Reichenheim, quoted by Mr. Plunkett, the
increase in the rate of wages in the last ten years has been
about 30 per cent. for female weavers, while in the case of male
labour it is more than double.&nbsp; The same complaints are
made, which we hear in this country, as to the effect of higher
pay in rendering the operatives less careful in their work, and
more insubordinate than formerly.</p>
<h3>Low wages and cheap production not convertible terms.</h3>
<p>The most recent inquiries tend to establish the fact, which I
have, on former occasions, endeavoured to urge on the attention
of employers, that underpaid labour is by no means the most
economical.&nbsp; It does not follow that, when a workman
receives more pay for exactly the same amount of labour, there is
no increase in the cost of production.&nbsp; It would be absurd
to put such an interpretation on the axiom assumed by my father,
when estimating the cost of work, that the cost of labour in a
fully peopled country was, as a general rule, the same, whatever
might be the nominal rate of daily wages.&nbsp; But, where the
principle of payment by the piece is adopted, (and, trades-union
opposition notwithstanding, no other system of payment can be
really equitable), there it will be found that labour, when
stimulated by a liberal reward, is far more productive than that
of the ill-paid operative.&nbsp; The reports to which I have
referred are full of illustrations on this point.</p>
<h3>Belgium.</h3>
<p>In Belgium, all the factory occupiers are of opinion that the
English operatives are far superior to the Flemish.&nbsp; An
Englishman, being better fed, possesses <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>greater
physical power, produces as much work in ten hours as a Fleming
in twelve, and, understanding the machinery which he works, he
can point to the cause of an accident; whereas in Ghent
half-an-hour is constantly lost in seeking for the reason of a
stoppage.&nbsp; Although the rates of wages are lower, and the
hours of labour longer; English manufacturers have but little to
fear from Belgian competition.</p>
<h3>Russia.</h3>
<p>Mr. Egerton states, that, in Russia, 13 hours a day is the
average length of the hours of labour, children generally working
the same time as men; and yet there is no country in which there
is so great a waste of labour.&nbsp; In mills where the best and
newest machinery is used, it is necessary to limit the earnings,
which, if large in amount, would be expended in drinking.&nbsp;
In England a spinner will, with his assistants, attend to 2,000
spindles.&nbsp; In Russia, he never has more than 1,000, and
generally 500 spindles under his charge.</p>
<h3>Switzerland.</h3>
<p>Mr. Gosling says of the Swiss workman, that he is inferior to
the British workman in physical strength and energy.</p>
<h3>France.</h3>
<p>The French manufacturers insist strongly on the greater cost
of production in their country as compared with England.&nbsp;
They estimate the cost of wages per week for the hands employed
upon 10,000 spindles at &pound;59. 10<i>s.</i>, as compared with
&pound;41, which would be the corresponding amount in an English
factory.&nbsp; &lsquo;The value of the English workman,&rsquo;
says Mr. Redgrave, &lsquo;still remains pre-eminent, although the
interval between him and his competitors is not so great as it
was; <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>he
has not retrograded, but they have advanced.&rsquo;&nbsp; We see
too much of intemperance in England, but there is much reason to
complain in Belgium and the manufacturing districts of France,
where the cheapness of intoxicating liquors is a fearful
temptation to the working classes.</p>
<h3>Increasing production with the same number of hands.</h3>
<p>The progressive development in the skill of our factory
operatives has been clearly shown in the comparison, instituted
by Messrs. Bridges and Holmes, of the tasks, now performed, with
the amount of work allotted to the hands, as ascertained by the
Factory Commission of 1833.&nbsp; Messrs. Bridges and Holmes
estimate that the proportion of spindles in 1833 was 112 to each
hand, while the corresponding number at the present day would be
517 spindles.&nbsp; The speed of the mule has been so much
increased, that more stretches are now made in 10&frac12; hours
than formerly in twelve.&nbsp; In 1848 a female would have had
only two looms, now she will attend to four.&nbsp; The speed of
the power looms in 1833 varied between 90 and 112; it now varies
between 170 and 200 picks a minute.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all the
improvements of mechanism, the cotton-weaver of the present day
is subject to a greater strain than his predecessor of forty
years ago.</p>
<p>From a consideration of all these facts, we have reason to
congratulate employers in England on the possession of a body of
workmen superior to those of any other country.&nbsp; We may also
assert, on their behalf, that in no other country of the Old
World is the same solicitude displayed for the welfare of the
workmen.</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>I
observe with regret the frequently repeated manifestations of
disaffection on the part of the working classes on the Continent
towards their employers.&nbsp; Lord Brabazon, in his able report
on the condition of the industrial classes in France, quotes some
painful illustrations of the entire want of confidence between
class and class in that distracted country, where
&lsquo;Communistic principles have done so much to alienate the
affections of the workmen from their employers,&rsquo; and where
a large proportion of those engaged in manufacturing industry
live in a condition of wretchedness and misery, of which, I
venture to hope, very few of those, who can command regular
employment in this country, have any experience.&nbsp; At
Elb&oelig;uf we are told of a certain manufacturer who, during
the period of dearth, bought a large quantity of provisions, with
the view of reselling them to his workmen at a low rate, but who
was obliged to renounce his humane project; because the
workpeople imagined it was a pretext for making money out of
their misery.&nbsp; At Lyons, where no social distinctions keep
asunder the numerous small employers from the employed, the
sympathy which formerly existed between the owner of the loom and
his assistants is no longer found.</p>
<p>When I turn from this gloomy picture to those bright
recollections, the most precious portion of the heritage, which I
have received from my lamented father, and call to mind the
cordial relations, which he always preserved with vast multitudes
of workmen, and with a large staff of agents of every grade and
disposition <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>of mind; still more, when I see among contemporary
employers so many evidences of the same success in conciliating
their dependents, I thank my God from the very bottom of my
heart, that I was born an Englishman.</p>
<h3>Employment of children in Belgium.</h3>
<p>While in England we are happily doing away with the great evil
of employing young children in our factories, all the Chambers of
Commerce in Belgium unite in deploring the increasing moral and
physical degeneracy of the working classes, owing to the
premature employment of children.&nbsp; In the Belgian factories
for spinning and weaving flax, cotton, and wool, children from
ten to twelve years old are very generally admitted, and work
twelve hours a day.&nbsp; In the Belgian coal-pits 8,000 children
under fourteen years of age, of both sexes, are employed.&nbsp;
Of children between ten and twelve 2,400 are employed, 700 above
and 1,700 below ground.</p>
<p>In 1866, out of their total population of 4,827,000, more than
one-half were unable to read or write.&nbsp; The necessity for
the employment of children is best proved by the description
given by Mr. Kennedy, of the position of the Belgian operatives
at Alost and Tirmonde, where a first-class hand earns &pound;28 a
year, while the smallest sum on which a man can exist is
&pound;20 a year.&nbsp; Indeed, existence is only made possible
by the employment of children in factories, and by the possession
of a small garden in which vegetables are raised.</p>
<h3>Employment of women in England.</h3>
<p>In the English factories, where a larger proportion of women
are employed than in the factories abroad, it has recently been
proposed that the number of hours <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>of labour should be limited by
law.&nbsp; The proposal is supported by Messrs. Bridges and
Holmes, on the ground that, by exciting a spirit of rivalry
between them, women can be goaded on to over-exert themselves in
a manner, which would not be observed among men.&nbsp; A woman,
we are told, who can mind four looms without an assistant has a
certain position, and becomes an object of attention.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hoo&rsquo;s a four-loomer; hoo&rsquo;s like to be
wed,&rsquo; will be commonly remarked of such an one.</p>
<p>The Association of Employers, though differing on almost every
other subject from Messrs. Bridges and Holmes, suggest that women
should be excluded from factories for three months after their
confinement.&nbsp; Great evils have been found, by experience, to
ensue from the too early return of the mothers to factory
labour.&nbsp; Let us venture to hope that another Session of
Parliament will not be allowed to pass by, without placing on the
Statute Book a legal prohibition against a practice, which is
universally condemned by those most competent to form an
opinion.</p>
<h3>Shorter hours of labour.</h3>
<p>The demand for a reduction of the hours of labour, which has
been so strongly and successfully urged by certain classes of our
operatives, is not universally supported either at home or
abroad.</p>
<p>The average length of a working day in Switzerland is twelve
hours, exclusive of the time for meals.&nbsp; The general
tendency is to a reduction of hours, and laws have been passed,
limiting the length of the working day in some cantons to twelve
hours.&nbsp; These changes are, however, almost entirely due to
the efforts <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>of local politicians.&nbsp; A proposal of this nature
recently made in Zurich, and sanctioned by the Cantonal
Legislature, was eventually thrown out by the popular vote.</p>
<p>At Rouen, Mr. Redgrave found no strong desire for a diminution
of the hours of labour in the cotton factories.&nbsp; The
operatives were chiefly solicitous for a rise of wages.&nbsp; On
this subject the workpeople of all countries seem to entertain
similar views.&nbsp; Messrs. Bridges and Holmes, in their report
on the condition of operatives in English factories, say that the
workpeople are by no means unanimous.&nbsp; Among the women
especially, many are apathetic, and some are positively opposed
to a limitation of the working hours.</p>
<p>In the United States, at Lowell, near Boston, I ascertained by
personal inquiry on the spot, that the working hours were sixty
per week, and that no indication had yet been given of a
disposition among the operatives to reduce the hours.</p>
<h3>Decline of pauperism.</h3>
<p>Though there may be reason to regret that the working class
have not reaped more substantial and universal benefits from the
recent additions to their wages; we have at least the
satisfaction of knowing that there has been some slight decrease
in the amount of pauperism, and in the proportion of persons in
receipt of relief to the whole population.</p>
<h3>Emigration.</h3>
<p>Meanwhile the tide of emigration has never ceased to
flow.&nbsp; The proportion, too, of English and Scotch to Irish
has, of late years, much increased.&nbsp; In 1872 the wide labour
field of the United States absorbed 199,000 out of a total number
of 252,000 emigrants <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>from the United Kingdom.&nbsp; In the
same period 33,000 sailed for the ports of British North
America.&nbsp; The United States offer many advantages to the
newly-arrived emigrants.&nbsp; The homestead law gives, for a
merely nominal sum, the right to a homestead and 160 acres of
land to every individual, who is actually a citizen of the United
States, or has declared his intention of becoming such.</p>
<p>In examining the various circumstances, which tend to raise
the price of labour in England, the prevailing high wages in the
United States, and the increased facilities for emigration, must
ever be kept in view.&nbsp; The nominal rate of wages in America
may indeed frequently convey a delusive idea of prosperity; yet
it cannot be doubted that the thrifty, skilful, and industrious
artisan has large opportunities of advancement in the New
World.</p>
<p>A great majority of the emigrants go out to join some friends
already satisfactorily established.&nbsp; When this is not the
case, it is essential to the emigrant&rsquo;s success that he
should have accumulated not merely a sufficient sum, to defray
the cost of his voyage across the Atlantic, but enough to enable
him to travel, if necessary, far into the interior, and to visit,
it may be several, rapidly rising cities in the West, before
finally settling down.&nbsp; The artisan, who is able to maintain
himself for some months after landing at New York, and to make a
wide exploration of the country, will be sure in the end to find
a favourable opening.&nbsp; Alas, how few of those who emigrate
from this country are possessed of such resources!</p>
<h3><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Wages
in America.</h3>
<p>Many examples of the prosperity of the working classes came
under my own observation on a recent visit to America.&nbsp; The
workpeople are paid as far as possible by the piece.&nbsp; The
monthly pay-sheet at the Merrimac Mills, at Lowell, where 2,600
hands are employed, amounts to 75,000 dollars, which gives an
average of thirty dollars a month, or 30<i>s.</i> a week.&nbsp;
The majority of the workpeople are Americans, but there are many
from Canada and the Old Country.&nbsp; The proprietors of the
mills have established several lodging-houses for the unmarried
women whom they employ.&nbsp; At each of these houses some thirty
women are lodged.&nbsp; The house is placed under the supervision
of a respectable matron.&nbsp; The cost of living is 3&frac12;
dollars a week, and female operatives can earn from 14<i>s.</i>
to 16<i>s.</i> a week over and above the cost of their board and
lodging.&nbsp; The men pay for board 2<i>s.</i> a day, and their
wages vary from 7<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> a day.</p>
<p>At the Lonsdale Company&rsquo;s Cotton Mills, near Providence,
in a factory containing 40,000 spindles, one spinner attends to
1,408 spindles, and in weaving, one weaver attends to from four
to six looms.&nbsp; In England, the proportion would be, on the
average, one hand to every three looms, working at a higher speed
than they have attained in America.&nbsp; Male weavers were
earning from 44<i>s.</i> to 52<i>s.</i>, and female weavers from
40<i>s.</i> to 44<i>s.</i> weekly.&nbsp; Spinners earn from
4<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> a day.&nbsp; Women pay for board and
lodging in lodging-houses, provided by their employers,
12<i>s.</i>, and men 16<i>s.</i> a week.&nbsp; The operatives,
earning these wages, are better able to save money than the
operatives in our <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>own country; and many of the hands at the Lonsdale Mills
have &pound;1,000 to their credit in the Savings Bank.&nbsp; At
the great Harmony Mills at Cohoes, near Albany, where 4,000 hands
are employed, two-thirds are emigrants to the States, principally
English and Scotch, although there are many Germans and some
French.&nbsp; The general wages are for women from 3<i>s.</i> to
6<i>s.</i> a day, for men from 6<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> a
day.&nbsp; The cost of living is moderate, and assuming that a
female operative earns 28<i>s.</i> a week&mdash;by no means a
high average&mdash;she has 16<i>s.</i> a week to spend on dress
and luxuries.&nbsp; At Cohoes a weaver attends to four, five, or
six looms, but the machinery is not worked at so high a rate of
speed as in Lancashire.&nbsp; The mule is never worked at a speed
exceeding three stretches a minute.</p>
<p>In Quebec wages have of late been rapidly advancing.&nbsp;
Artisans can now command 8<i>s.</i> a day, and labourers employed
in unloading ships, whose employment, however, is uncertain in
summer, and in winter wholly ceases, earn 10<i>s.</i> to
12<i>s.</i> a day.&nbsp; A man with a family can live well on
4<i>s.</i> a day.&nbsp; The long winter is the great drawback to
the prosperity of the working class in Canada.&nbsp; Quebec has
its Wapping, its extensive suburbs, chiefly occupied by the
working classes; and there is no external indication in these
quarters of a condition of life superior to that attained by the
majority of our working men at home.&nbsp; In the Ottawa
district, in Canada, the young farmers are able to find
employment in winter by leaving their homes, and going up to the
forests to cut timber.&nbsp; They earn 30<i>s.</i> <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>a week, and
they are boarded in addition.&nbsp; In the spring the lumberer
returns home with a considerable sum of money saved.&nbsp; He
carries on his farming operations throughout the open season, and
returns to the forests in the autumn.&nbsp; The life is toilsome,
and involves a long separation from the fireside at home; but the
perseverance of a few years will result in the accumulation of a
valuable capital for farming operations, and secure to the
settler his future independence.</p>
<p>Ottawa is one of the rising towns of Canada.&nbsp; Its
prosperity is derived from the timber trade, and from its being
the seat of the Government.&nbsp; Wages in Ottawa were last year
(I speak of 1872) extravagantly high.&nbsp; Masons were earning
14<i>s.</i> a day.&nbsp; All classes of artisans employed in
building were paid from 10<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> a day.&nbsp;
For four or five months in winter building operations are
suspended; but provisions are cheap, and house rent is the only
costly item.</p>
<p>At Hamilton, in Upper Canada, the wages for artisans are
8<i>s.</i> a day.&nbsp; House-rent is about 28<i>s.</i> a
month.&nbsp; The expense of fuel in winter is nearly equal to the
sum paid for house-rent.&nbsp; Food is cheap.&nbsp; A stock of
salt beef can be laid down for the winter at the price of
1&frac12;<i>d.</i> a pound.&nbsp; The agriculturists in the
Hamilton district are in a prosperous condition.&nbsp; Every
settler travels in a light waggon, drawn by a pair of serviceable
horses.&nbsp; The population seemed robust and healthy.</p>
<p>In other settlements forming part of the Dominion, the
appearance of the people was less satisfactory.&nbsp; At
Charlottetown, in Prince Edward&rsquo;s Island, the universal <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>vehicle is
drawn by one horse instead of two, as at Hamilton.&nbsp; It was
sad to see the population generally so pale and thin, and, in
appearance, sickly and out of health.&nbsp; It is hard to find a
reason for this marked physical deterioration of the descendants
of Scotch, Irish, and English settlers.&nbsp; Probably the long
winter is, to a great extent, the cause.&nbsp; The impossibility
of active outdoor operations at that season, and the consequent
temptation to spend the day in smoking and drinking in
over-heated rooms, is extremely prejudicial to the health of the
population.&nbsp; At Picton, in Nova Scotia, the inhabitants
appeared more robust.&nbsp; The wages for ordinary shipwrights
are 8<i>s.</i> a day, and taking into consideration the cost of
living, the working classes are as well off as in any part of
Canada.</p>
<p>In comparing the American and English operatives, or, rather,
the English operatives, when transplanted to the States, with the
hands who have remained in the Old Country, it would seem that
there is, as a rule, a higher development of skill in the
individual operatives.&nbsp; The difference is attributable to
the conviction that the present high rate of wages in the States
could not be maintained; unless the utmost skill and diligence
were put forth.</p>
<h3>Arbitration.</h3>
<p>The results which have followed from the reference of disputes
relating to wages to arbitration are a sign of the happiest
augury for the future relations between employers and
employed.&nbsp; It has been urged, on the part of the employers,
that the working class will only accept the decision of
arbitrators, when it is favourable to <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>themselves.&nbsp; But in this, as in
many other respects, the organisation of the trades unions, and
the influence which the more enlightened workmen, acting as
members of the executive committees of the unions, possess over
their less-instructed fellow-workmen, have been the means of
securing obedience to every decision arrived at after careful
investigation, conducted in an impartial spirit.&nbsp; Such
influence becomes more important when the members of the trades
unions are for the most part uneducated men.&nbsp; It is always
more difficult for an employer to negotiate or to argue with a
boiler-maker than with a fitter.&nbsp; The executive councils of
the unions have entitled themselves to the gratitude of the
employers of labour, by accepting the use of machinery, the
substitution of which for manual labour becomes more and more
indispensable with every advance in the standard of wages.</p>
<h3>Legitimate province of the trades unions.</h3>
<p>It is not by encouraging useless strikes, or by making an
attempt, which in the end must always be defeated, to sustain a
vast body of workmen and their families, when not in the receipt
of wages, that the wire-pullers of the trades unions will best
serve the interests of their clients, or enhance their personal
influence among them.&nbsp; But there is a wide field of
usefulness open to these captains of our great hosts of workmen,
in which success is to be attained, not by war, but by
diplomacy.&nbsp; The state of the trades, in which their clients
are employed, should be carefully watched, and every variation in
the prices quoted, every fluctuation in the cost of the raw
materials should <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>be noted.&nbsp; And here I may frankly admit that the
proposal of the International for a universal strike contained a
few grains of wisdom; for it is clear that, if the cost of
producing an article in England were so much enhanced by an
advance of wages, that the foreign manufacturer would be enabled
to undersell us in every market, it would be an act of
self-destruction for English workmen to insist upon a rise, which
would have the inevitable effect of depriving them of
employment.</p>
<p>In such a case, unless the workmen in the competing countries
can agree to act in concert, an advance is impossible; unless by
superior skill or machinery the more highly paid workman is able
to turn out a larger amount of work.</p>
<h3>Foreign competition.</h3>
<p>It has been already pointed out that in England we have to
contend against competition of two kinds&mdash;against the
cheaper labour of the Continent on the one side, and against the
superior natural resources of America on the other.&nbsp; While
we occupy at the present time a highly favoured position, which
has been attained not merely by the skill of our workmen, but by
the administrative skill of their employers, and the gradual
accumulation of an ample capital in their hands, the race with
other great manufacturing countries is very close.&nbsp; The
Swiss have entered into competition with our own manufacturers,
both in the home and foreign trades.&nbsp; The exports of textile
fabrics from Switzerland, as we learn from Mr. Gosling&rsquo;s
report, have risen from &pound;12,485,000 in 1860, to <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>&pound;26,464,000 in 1871, an advance of 112&frac12; per
cent.&nbsp; In this total the exports to the United States have
risen from &pound;509,000 in 1862, to &pound;2,159,000 in 1872,
in other words, over 324 per cent.&nbsp; In cheap silks and
ribbons the Swiss are able to compete with the British producer
in the English market; and, to sum up the case in the words of
Mr. Gosling, &lsquo;The advantages of Switzerland in competition
with Great Britain are the use of water power as a substitute for
steam power to the extent of upwards of 80 per cent., low wages,
long hours of labour, and a minimum expenditure for
management.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the other hand, as an inland country,
Switzerland has to pay heavy freights, the workmen are inferior
in activity to our own, buildings for machinery are more costly,
and from want of capital, production is on a smaller scale than
here.&nbsp; The balance, however, seems to be greatly in favour
of Switzerland, and cannot fail to become greater from day to
day.</p>
<p>Such being the case as regards textile industry, Mr. Lothian
Bell has recently pointed out, that, in ores of the finer
descriptions, the resources of the United States are unlimited,
while in coal our own wealth is, in comparison, poverty.&nbsp;
There is but one bar to the boundless production of minerals in
the New World, that is to say, the want of hands to manufacture
them.</p>
<h3>Communism in Germany.</h3>
<p>A large number of the working class in Germany have been
fascinated by the fanciful theories of Lassalle.&nbsp; His system
is founded entirely upon the pernicious principle that the State
is to do everything, and the <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>people nothing for themselves.&nbsp;
Karl Marx, as the successor of Lassalle, is the ruling spirit of
the German socialists, and has become a prominent figure from his
connection with the International.&nbsp; The socialist journals
in Germany delight to reproduce the programme and doctrines of
that society.&nbsp; They make noisy professions of atheism.&nbsp;
They applauded the insurrection of the Commune in Paris.&nbsp;
They have a collection of songs of their own.&nbsp; They disavow
the warlike policy of Germany, and have endeavoured to substitute
the community of class interests for the community of race,
language, and country.&nbsp; It must not, however, be supposed
that the number of these unpractical visionaries is proportionate
to the noise, which they make in the world.&nbsp; The influence
of socialistic doctrines is not so great in England as on the
Continent, and it is weaker in America than in England.&nbsp; I
hope, therefore, that no disposition may be manifested here to
abandon the hopeful work of social, moral, and material progress
for the pursuit of visionary and impossible schemes.</p>
<p>The amelioration of the condition of the poor is not to be
brought about by destroying the ancient fabric and foundations of
our social and political system.&nbsp; It is easy to destroy but
most difficult to restore the institutions created by past
generations, in which there lived men not less great, and wise,
and good than the most gifted of our own contemporaries.&nbsp;
Mr. Ruskin, a devoted friend of the working classes, in a passage
of more than ordinary eloquence, has <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>truly said, &lsquo;This is the thing,
which I know, and which, if you labour faithfully, you shall know
also,&mdash;that in Reverence is the chief power and joy of
life;&mdash;Reverence, for what is pure and bright in your own
youth; for what is true and tried in the age of others; for all
that is gracious among the living, great among the dead, and
marvellous in the Powers that cannot die.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Co-operation.</h3>
<p>Our artisans may believe that the profits of former days were
so large that employers can afford to pay the present rates of
wages, without raising their charges to the consumers.&nbsp;
There is but one means, by which this fallacy can be
exposed.&nbsp; The workmen must become to a certain extent their
own employers.&nbsp; In a co-operative establishment, created in
part by his own hardly-earned savings, the handicraftsman will
find himself called upon to apportion equitably the earnings of
his business between labour and capital.&nbsp; In this double
relation he will learn how great are the difficulties, which
beset the employment of capital in productive industry in a
country, in which competition is so keen as it is in
England.&nbsp; In no other country does capital command so low a
rate of interest; and, if large accumulations of capital have
been made, and money is therefore cheap, it should not be
inferred that the rate of profit has been high by comparison with
other countries, but rather that our employers of labour, as a
class, have been distinguished by their frugality, their
perseverance, and their enterprise.&nbsp; I am grateful,
therefore, to Mr. Holyoake, for his vindication of their claims
at the recent Co-operative Congress.&nbsp; He justly <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>said that
capital was the enemy of nobody, but rather the nursing mother of
production.</p>
<p>The co-operative principle, in its application to the business
of distribution, has been already most successfully
developed.&nbsp; My desire is to encourage working men to create
co-operative establishments for the purposes of production.&nbsp;
The accumulation of the necessary capital is an obvious
difficulty; but as wages were never so high as at present, so
this obstacle can be more easily surmounted now than at any
former time.&nbsp; Some men may object to recognise the special
responsibilities of a fellow-workman holding the office of
manager of a large business, by giving a proportionate
salary.&nbsp; It is because the recognition of authority is
essential, whenever anything practical is to be done, that the
International Society has shown such uncompromising hostility to
the co-operative principle.&nbsp; The denial of a proportionate
reward for superior intelligence or industry is the first article
of its catechism.&nbsp; The absurdity of attempting to combine
the energies of the men for any definite object, without placing
a competent chief at their head, has been humorously exposed by
Mr. Carlyle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ships,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;did not
use the ballot-box at all, and they rejected the phantasm species
of captains.&nbsp; Phantasm captains with unanimous
votings!&nbsp; These are considered to be all the law and
prophets at present.&nbsp; If a man shake out of his mind the
universal noise of political doctors in this generation, and in
the last generation or two, and consider the matter face to face
with his own sincere intelligence looking at it, I venture to say
he would find this a very extraordinary method <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>of
navigating, whether in the Straits of Magellan, or the
undiscovered sea of time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>English workmen are less easily deluded by tall talk and
sophistry than the more excitable populations of the Latin race;
and I would earnestly invite them to apply their practical
sagacity to the difficult yet hopeful experiment of co-operative
industry.</p>
<h3>Demand and supply determine wages.</h3>
<p>I must once more repeat the familiar axiom, that the price of
labour, like that of every other commodity, must mainly depend
upon the relation between supply and demand.&nbsp; The wages of
skilled workmen have risen, because skilled workmen are
scarce.&nbsp; How shall we increase their number, and improve
their skill?&nbsp; My answer is, by bringing recruits into our
industrial army from a class of society, which has hitherto
exhibited too strong a prejudice against manual labour.&nbsp; The
same aversion to handicraft of every kind exists in the United
States and Canada.&nbsp; In America a skilled workman earns 30
dollars, a clerk only 15 dollars a week; and, while it is almost
as difficult for a clerk to obtain a situation in New York as in
London, a skilled workman can always command employment.&nbsp; It
is unnecessary to dwell on the evils that must ensue from a
disproportionate increase in the non-productive classes of the
community.&nbsp; Lord Bacon has truly said, that a population is
not to be reckoned only by numbers, for a smaller number that
spend more and earn less do wear out a greater number that live
lower and get more.&nbsp; My father&rsquo;s advice was often
sought by parents anxious for the future of their sons.&nbsp; His
counsel always was, that a young man, whose destiny it must be to
make <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>his
way, unaided, through the world, should begin by learning a
trade.&nbsp; It is a laudable ambition in a parent to endeavour
to raise his family to a better station in life.&nbsp; He cannot
bestow on his children too high an education.&nbsp; But a wise
man will be on his guard, lest the enjoyment of such advantages
should render those occupations distasteful, which afford the
most secure and ample livelihood to those whose lot it is to
labour.&nbsp; When justly appreciated, the condition of the
skilled artisan should be as much esteemed as that of any other
class of the community.&nbsp; He whose life is passed in
performing such needed services for his fellow-men, whatever his
special calling, holds an honorable station, and social dignity
will ever be most effectually maintained by those who are the
least dependent upon the favours of others.</p>
<h3>Forethought.</h3>
<p>In conclusion, I would tender a few words of advice to my
fellow-countrymen of the so-called working classes, for whose
welfare I am bound to feel the deepest solicitude.&nbsp; Their
just claim to share in the benefits arising from a thriving
industry has of late been liberally recognised.&nbsp; The
earnings in many trades have been unprecedented.&nbsp; It should
not be forgotten that forethought is an especial duty in a time
of prosperity.&nbsp; At no distant period, the progress of our
commerce may sustain at least a temporary check.&nbsp; It will be
sad indeed if the receding tide leaves behind it multitudes of
our highly-paid workmen without the slightest provision to meet a
period of adversity.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
